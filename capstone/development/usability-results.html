            <h3>Significant Observations</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Typewriter Effect</li>
                <p>The JS library that I used has a few bugs I need to fix. The user is able to skip through the text with the button so text will overlap and create a weird effect.</p>
                <li>UI</li>
                <p>The button to skip through the text feels a little out of place.The button also moves a lot because of the library that I am using. I was recommended to use the keyboard instead of a button on screen.</p>
                <li>UX Implementation</li>
                <p>There is not enough guidance for the user to understand what to do besides use the button. There needs to be some sort of directions to encourage user input.</p>
            </ol>
            

            <h3>Updates and Implementation</h3>
            <p>I will get rid of the button in the text box and use the space bar instead to navigate through text. I will also have the text display as an entire paragraph instead of a single line. I will also add icons for when the user can interact with the images. I want to add more subtle animations/interactions throughout the project.</p>
