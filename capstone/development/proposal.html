        <h2>Topic and Audience</h2>
        <p>The topic I want to explore is mental health and how it has an affect on individuals during their day to day life. Because I am a college student, my target audience is individuals around the same age as me. I want to cater to everyone as mental health relates to everyone, but I can only speak from my personal experience and those around me.</p>
        <h2>Challenging Mental Models</h2>
        <p>The topic of mental health relates most to our discussion of challenging mental models. Mental health awareness has become much more apparent during the last decade or so, but there are still many accessibility problems. A lot of individuals can't take the necessary steps in seeking help, simply because it's either not physically possible or there is no guidance. I consider this a very big issue and want to shine light on how to seek help in different ways that is comfortable and possible for everyone.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>I want my project to be based on interaction. I want to make a visual novel and have my project be choice based for the user to be able to choose their own story. My project will be heavy on visuals and I want it to feel like a game. I want to have text interaction and scroll interactions.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>One main challenge I feel I will encounter is scope. I know a small story is do-able but keeping track of the amount of interaction is what concerns me. One way I can keep things from becoming overwhelming is limiting player interaction to 1-2 types of interactions. I feel like my project can go in many directions, once I get a solid idea for the type of story I want to create I can surround the style of my project around that.</p>
